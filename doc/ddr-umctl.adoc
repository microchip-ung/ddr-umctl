= DDR configuration tool for Microchip platforms

== TERMS and ABBREVIATIONS

----
HIF		Host Interface
ODT		On-Die Termination
PUB		PHY utility block
SoC		System on a Chip
----

== Requirements

The tools are developed using the `ruby` scripting language, which
must be available.

The scripts may run under both `Linux` or `Windows`. The `Windows`
environment may require installing the `WSL2` package to emulate
`Linux`.

== Supported platforms

This tool is supported form the following target SoC platforms:

* sparx5  (ARMv8 A53 dual-core)
* lan966x (ARMV7 A7 single-core)
* lan969x (ARMv8 A53 single-core)

== Introduction

This software package contain a set of tools that can create DDR
configurations specific to a target platform and board design. A board
design defines the physical DDR memory system, such that the DDR
controller needs a carefully crafted configuration to ensure a stable
and effective operation.

The DDR controller supported is the _Synopsis uMCTL2_ DesignWare
component, accompanied with a _Synopsis PHY Utility Block_.

The supported platforms all use DDR3 or DDR3 + DDR4.

== Workflow

The tool works by accepting a _configuration profile_ as input, which
can be transformed into a compact representation of the many
configuration options the target, *specifically* generated for a given
platform and board.

The output configuration may be represented in different formats,
depending on the target platform.

The different formats are:

[cols="1,1,4"]
|===
| format | platform | comments

| source | lan966x | The configuration is output to "C" code, and compiled into the target firmware.
| devicetree | lan969x, sparx5 | The configuration is output to device-tree format, which is added to a a target image (as a separate entity).
| yaml | -none- | The configuration is stored in YAML format. The format can be used for documentation purposes as well as for comparing with other configurations.
|===

The output representation is dictated by the target implementation of
the actual target system DDR driver operating
environment. Specifically, 'device tree' support may not be available
on a given target (Example: `lan966x`).

The workflow of working with the DDR configuration is illustrated below:

== Configuration parameters

At the top level, the following user-level parameters are
available:

[cols="1m,3m,6"]
|===
| Keyword | Type | Description

| platform | sparx5 \| lan966x \| lan969x | The name of the target platform SoC
| clock_speed | integer | The clock speed of the DDR data bus. See later.
| mem_size | integer | Total Memory Size (in Mbytes)
| mem_type | DDR3 \| DDR4 | The DDR memory type of the equipped DDR devices.
| device_bus_width | x8 \| x16 | Bus width of the equipped DDR devices. `x8` support is experimental.
| enable_half_bus | boolean | Configures the memory topology to use only half of the SoC data bus width
| active_ranks | integer | The number of (active) ranks in the memory topology.
| ecc_mode | 0 \| 4 | The ECC mode to employ. ECC mode `0` implies ECC is disabled, mode `4` is "sec/ded over 1 beat"
| mem_profile | string | The filename of a file defining DDR memory address generation. See later.
| _2T_mode | boolean | Whether `2T` timing should be used
| board | string | The filename of file containing board specific tuning parameters. See later.

|===

=== Bus width

The bus width of the SoC differs between different platforms. Below is
an overview of the (maximum) bus width supported per platform.

[cols="1m,1m"]
|===
| Platform | Bus Width

| sparx5 | 32 
| lan966x | 16
| lan969x | 16
|===

The effective bus width can optionally be reduced with the
`enable_half_bus` parameter. Note that this is currently only
supported on `sparx5`.

The `device_bus_width` parameter describe the bus width of the
individual DDR chips - of which there may be several. For example, a
`sparx5` 32-bit topology with ECC will require 5 chips of `x8` width
to naturally match the 32 bits data plus the ECC bits. Using
`enable_half_bus` you could use 3 chips of `x16` width, but you would
be leaving half of the ECC memory device unused - while having a
simpler physical board layout.

=== Clock speed.

The _clock_speed_ affects a lot of the calculated parameters for the
memory controller.

Whether or not the clock speed can be changed or not, depends on the
target system (and the actual driver implementation).

The current state of the clock speed is described below. 

[cols="1m,3m,6"]
|===
| Platform | Supported clocks | Notes

| sparx5 | 2500 \| 2000 \| 1667 \| 1250 | NB: DDR4 will only work at 1667 Mhz
| lan966x | 1200 | Fixed clock
| lan969x | 2400 | Fixed clock

|===

=== Memory profile parameter _mem_profile_

In order to define the way HIF addresses are used to select ranks,
groups and DDR devices, a separate YAML file is used. This
configuration file may be used by several configurations (board
designs) using similar physical DDR topology.

The _mem_profile_ file defines the so-called "address map" registers
(and sub-fields). An example is given below.

Note: The registers and sub-fields vary a little between platforms, so
not all registers apply to all supported platforms. Refer to [1],
section "2.11: Address Mapper".

=== Memory profile parameter _board_

In order to control memory settings relating to `ODT` and general
board tuning, this file can be used to define *all* parameters where a
specific is needed which is different from the default or by this tool
calculated value. As such, this file can be used to override specific
parameters.

.Board file example (_lan966x_)
[source]
dfitmg0:
  - DFI_T_CTRL_DELAY: 4
  - DFI_RDDATA_USE_DFI_PHY_CLK: 0
  - DFI_T_RDDATA_EN: 3
  - DFI_WRDATA_USE_DFI_PHY_CLK: 0
  - DFI_TPHY_WRDATA: 1
  - DFI_TPHY_WRLAT: 2
mr1:
  - RTT_2: 1

All supported registers and sub-fields can be defined. See the full
list of supported registers below.

== Generating a DDR configuration file

When generating a DDR configuration file, you will be using the
_./scripts/gen_cfg.rb_ script, and supplying the input profile file name as the first argument.

.cfg_gen.rb argument syntax
[source]
$ ./scripts/gen_cfg.rb --help
Usage: cfg_gen.rb [options] [config-file]
    -d, --debug                      Enable debug messages
    -v, --verbose                    Enable verbose messages
    -f, --format <format>            Use format (devicetree, yaml, source)

An example run could be:

.cfg_gen.rb example run
----
./scripts/gen_cfg.rb -f source configs/profiles/lan969x.yaml > config.c
----

And the output would be:

};
----

Some platforms use the alternative `devicetree` format, but the
procedure is the same as for `C` source.

You can also use the `yaml` format. It is especially useful for
comparing alternate configurations using the _diff_cfg.rb_
script. YAML configurations can also be output to `source` or
`devicetree` configurations later with the _fmt_cfg.rb_ script.

== Supported DDR configuration registers

The supported DDR configuration registers are a subset of the full
UMCTL2 DDR controller registers. The registers supported in this tool
have been identified to contain options that typically may need
customization.

The configuration register set is currently different for the
_lan966x_ and the _lan969x_/_sparx5_ driver, due to differences in the
base IP version and IP configuration parameters.
