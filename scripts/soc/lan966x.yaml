          to avoid possible data bus contention as well as to give PHY enough time
          to switch the delay when changing ranks. The uMCTL2 arbitrates for bus access
          on a cycle-by-cycle basis; therefore after a write is scheduled, there are
          few clock cycles (determined by the value on RANKCTL.diff_rank_wr_gap register)
          in which only writes from the same rank are eligible to be scheduled. This
          prevents writes from other ranks from having fair access to the data bus.
          This parameter represents the maximum number of writes that can be scheduled
          consecutively to the same rank. After this number is reached, a delay equal
          to RANKCTL.diff_rank_wr_gap is inserted by the scheduler to allow all ranks
          a fair opportunity to be scheduled. Higher numbers increase bandwidth utilization,
          lower numbers increase fairness. This feature can be DISABLED by setting

          same rank can be performed back-to-back. Reads to different ranks require
          additional gap dictated by the register RANKCTL.diff_rank_rd_gap. This is
          to avoid possible data bus contention as well as to give PHY enough time
          to switch the delay when changing ranks. The uMCTL2 arbitrates for bus access
          on a cycle-by-cycle basis; therefore after a read is scheduled, there are
          few clock cycles (determined by the value on RANKCTL.diff_rank_rd_gap register)
          in which only reads from the same rank are eligible to be scheduled. This
          prevents reads from other ranks from having fair access to the data bus.
          This parameter represents the maximum number of reads that can be scheduled
          consecutively to the same rank. After this number is reached, a delay equal
          to RANKCTL.diff_rank_rd_gap is inserted by the scheduler to allow all ranks
          a fair opportunity to be scheduled. Higher numbers increase bandwidth utilization,
          lower numbers increase fairness. This feature can be DISABLED by setting
          this register to 0. When set to 0, the controller stays on the same rank
          as long as commands are available for it. Minimum programmable value is
